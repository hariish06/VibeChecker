The day of the dinner, my mom and I cooked some food to bring. I texted my friend a heads up that I was on my way to theirs. They replied saying that the dinner location was changed to a different friend’s house in the next city over, about 20 miles away.
I started driving towards the city and asked for the address. They said everyone was already there and that there wasn’t enough room for me. I tried following up but didn’t hear anything else from them afterwards, and I didn’t want to make a scene by texting other people that were there, as most were friend-adjacent for me.
I cut my losses, turned around and went home. I got an apology text a couple of days afterwards, but felt like the rug got pulled from under me. Super frustrating situation all around.
EDIT: Wow this post blew up right away, appreciate all y'alls kind words and gold. Yes, the food in the photo was what my mom and I cooked (lumpia and pancit 🇵🇭). No, i'm not AI. As for the friend, i'm planning to cut contact with her.",https://i.redd.it/cvd6ean0f27g1.jpeg
