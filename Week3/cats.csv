So they obviously threw out their declawed family cat to die innthis horrible heat wave... Not expecting him to be found...
So i renamed him in their system and took him over. Vet was worried about rabies with his nuero issues and I cuddled with him as he drifted to sleep. I've known him less than 24 hrs and i loved him.

Her biggest pride and joy were her cats, Olive and Pearl (the black cat and the grey tabby, respectively). I was never a cat person so I never truly wanted any, much to her dismay, and our living situations throughout the years meant we couldn’t have any. However, a couple years ago we were finally able to move into an apartment with just the two of us and quickly she made plans to get a cat. Not even a month into living there did she finally get her wish by bringing in the little runt of a litter from one of her friends. She didn’t even consult with me beforehand but nothing I could have said would have stopped her from bringing in Olive. I remember the moment she first took Olive out of her carrier for the first time and she just broke down crying. At that moment I felt an immense shame of having not tried hard enough not figure out a way to get her a cat sooner. But no matter, she was finally happy and a year later she also brought in little Pearl, who she selflessly decided to let me name.
Everyday her cats would rest and sleep on her. Now they rest on her side of the bed. When I’ve been coming home from the ICU, they greet me but I can see their eyes linger a little at the door, as if they expect their mom to follow shortly after.
It’s hard to say how conscious my gf was at the very end, if anything I said to her would reach her, but I promised her I would keep her cats protected forever and that I would love them the way she loved them. She made me a cat person and I’ll always love her for that.","['https://preview.redd.it/fts5n9134nbe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a5e30b7cb7b62848c8cfdd9279afbc6dd10aa22b', 'https://preview.redd.it/xozufw034nbe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=bfd312f70a506a613770305f01eee1d8d3feaa5e', 'https://preview.redd.it/dsz9cw034nbe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=02b601b921321965a215c84cf453429a763f3a63', 'https://preview.redd.it/pq17bw034nbe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=1a051a8ed1bb6a21884acce9b841078c04373501', 'https://preview.redd.it/0614fy034nbe1.jpg?width=108&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=8a74a9b2952613a25234d3e7f223cb2f06aa6219']"

They both went from cowering in the corner alone to much more confident together (something that they didn't even do meeting my personal cats). They spend all day grooming one another, snoozing together, and wrestling. While they are listed as needing to go with each other to a forever home, we've had multiple folks asking to adopt just Wonder Bread because they like the Siamese look. I'm hanging tight and saying no to separating them because I just can't bear to do it and they will have a space in foster care with us as long as they need. Anyway, I guess I'm just lamenting about how sad it is that people will ask you to break up a beautiful kitty friendship because they think one is cute and the other is not.
