Only a big burst of phone calls to Congress can stop them from allowing ISPs to charge us extra fees to access sites, apps, games, and ebooks.","Hey everyone,
the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.
Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services. ISPs shouldn't be able to favor their own e-readers or online book services over others. the Internet is a massive public library. We cant allow the FCC to give Comcast control over it.
But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.
We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents. Also, if your think your Rep's opposed to net neutrality, its all the more reason to call them. Those Reps need to hear your voice more than anyone.
Please, head over to
https://www.battleforthenet.com
, and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.
The time to act is now.
To reach the call in line directly by phone,
call 202-930-8550
.
When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say:
I support ""Title Two"" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.

Books,https://old.reddit.com/r/books/comments/muule5/unpopular_opinion_leaving_negative_reviews_on/,39172,2031,Unpopular opinion: leaving negative reviews on books because they contain triggers or themes you don't enjoy is wrong and unjust.,"I have just finished a trilogy and went on Goodreads to express my thoughts and appreciation. I did skim through the reviews to see what others thought of the books, as one does when stumbles onto the biggest book review site. What I have found is that people leave one star reviews saying
""it has sexual slavery in it"" ""it has rape in it"" ""it has lots of mention of gay sex in it""  ""it contains dubious consent""
etc etc. so it contains what is otherwise known as
triggers
in it. Now, this series' description is quite clear that it has mature content, it has slavery and that this is an enemies-to-lovers, fantasy with M/M romance in it. So assuming one doesn't blindly grab books from the bookshelf/download random stuff to their e-reader it is safe to say that readers are well aware of the summary before diving in, thus giving themselves and the writer consent to deal with and read about such unpleasant or out-of-the-ordinary themes.
If you know you are sensitive to slavery then why do you choose a book that has it as a main plot driver then go online and moan about it? Nobody forced you to pick this story, nobody forced you to keep on reading. It's like knowing you don't like milk in your tea, but ordering a milky tea then complain about not liking it. Or if you are not sure whether you like milk in your tea and you want to be adventurous and order one, then realise after a sip that this is not for you, you can just leave it and have one made in a way you know you enjoy. Not forcibly slurp it up then go complain about it.
Leaving negative reviews because, let's say, the writing style is not up to your standards or you find the story boring or the characters one-dimensional, that is fair enough and when you see thousands of people saying the same thing chances are their opinion has merit.
What really grinds my gears that when it comes to less-known or rising writers working with indie or small publishing houses these, frankly undeserved reviews can cut deep. It will only encourage writers to put themselves in a carefully constructed box of mainstream, acceptable themes and stories, and that is pretty much the death of artistic freedom for the sake of what? Political correctness? If we know anything about human history is that it is full of suffering, struggling, pain and bravery in the face of adversity; all of these include and caused by things modern societies view as triggers. I don't want to live in a world where books are being censored or cleansed for the sake of enlightened modernism.
​
To quote a classic:
“But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.”

: Wow, maybe it is not such an unpopular opinion after all,but certainly a bit controversial. Thank you for the awards.

You always dread the unfamiliar. Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes. They were given the new job, as custodians of our peace of mind, the focus of our understandable and rightful dread of being inferior; official censors, judges, and executors.

I mention I didn't really see the point, if I'm going to pay for a book I'd rather own it, I say. She gives me a strange look but just brushes the remark off.
Later, somebody is talking about libraries on reddit and how they are so great. I said that, while the selection is great, amazon is much better.
""Yeah but you have to pay for them on Amazon""
And thats when some gears started turning.
So I started looking into it. Turns out, for years I've always, mistakingly, though that, while the card was free, you had a rental fee to pay whenever you rent the books. I always figured that if I'm going to pay a fee to rent them, I would rather pay a little extra and keep them without worrying about late fees. Saves money, can read at my own place, and has led to a respectable book shelf.
Turns out I was wrong. So so wrong.

When I'm out with my wife and she's shopping at a seemingly endless stream of clothing stores, I find the nearest bookstore I can -- which isn't always easy -- and lose myself in the stacks. I also buy a lot of books, a dozen since July on Amazon alone. So I have a pretty keen sensitivity when it comes to relative pricing.
I'd like to buy more books from brick and mortars, but the business model for physical bookstores just isn't feasible anymore. They rarely have what I'm looking for in stock, and when they do it's often more than double the price I can find for the same book online. The store can often order the book for me, but their delivery times are often longer than it takes me to get a book delivered to my own house, which is at times under 24 hours -- with free shipping.
I love bookstores and will be sad to see them go. I'll miss them when they're gone. But they don't have much time left.",

Have you ever seen someone reading a book with a movie cover and thought less of them for only reading / discovering it because there's a movie? Cause of you have that says more about you than them.
It's still the same book though the content hasn't changed. I just don't see how people can care how you discovered the series rather than be excited that someone else shares their passion.

In reality, it's about people getting offended over nothing and demanding the government destroy offensive media but eventually  the people get too sensitive so that the only thing left is meaningless entertainment. The parallels to today make me feel uncomfortable.
Am I misunderstanding or were most people misquoting?
EDIT: I see now, I took a shallow view of what I remembered. Actually going back to it, especially Beatty's monologue, I see both ideas are a part of it but so is people not wanting to bother with complex ideas, and apparently Bradbury hates technology. Maybe one part over sensitivity, one part government involvement, and two parts people wanting instant gratification. I still believe it's mostly the fault of the people

Somewhere along the line the internet completely overtook my reading hobby. After a few years of almost no reading at all, I'm finally back in!","I'm sure there aren't many who actually care, but I'm feeling good so I thought I'd share!
Growing up, I was the biggest bibliophile. I'd read whatever, whenever, wherever. My favorite past time was reading, and my second favorite past time was finding new books to read. I'd devour whole books in one sitting, whole series in one week. I had a genuine, unrelenting passion for words and I did whatever I could to consume them.
I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the line my phone/the internet/social media slowly inched its way into the space which once held my desire to read. My attention span got to the point that even when/if I did try to read a book, I couldn't make it past a page without having to put it down and do something else. In the past couple of years I've read only a very small handful of books - some of which took me months or even the entire year. I've had years pass without picking up a single book, despite having hundreds at my disposal. I've realised just how much social media and other electronic activities have invaded and infiltrated my life multiple times throughout the years, but the idea of doing what I once loved became scary and daunting. I'd pick up a book to try and break the cycle, but I'd get hit with the new goldfish-attention-span, or my phone would ding, or I'd sit there and re-read the same page over and over again 17 times before realising I was still on the same page.
I think for a while there I just gave up. I didn't feel the things I used to feel while reading, I couldn't recreate that genuine desire. I resigned to the idea that the thing I used to love most was just a long forgotten chapter in an old part of my life. I stopped trying.
But a couple of weeks ago, I decided to have a Harry Potter movie marathon for the first time in a while. I got sucked in, moreso than usual - and had an idea. Of all the times I've tried to get back into reading, I had never tried to re-read something that I used to love. I always tried the latest hits, or something I heard about somewhere. I had never thought to revisit an old love, try to rekindle that old flame by well, rekindling an old flame! So I went out, bought the first book in the Harry Potter series (one of my absolute favorites when I was younger) and decided to give it a go. I put my phone away, made myself a cozy reading area, and just decided to try it without forcing myself into the pressure of trying on a new book.
Now I know it's still early on, but I honestly think it's done the trick. I sat down, with the idea that I would give it 15-30 minutes to start, and ended up devouring the whole book in less than a couple of hours. I loved being able to revisit this world that I used to love so much, and I loved being able to discover new things within a story I was already familiar with. It's been less than 48 hours since I started, and I'm already onto the 3rd book. That's almost 3 books in 48 hours -- which is 3 more books than I've read in the past 2(?) years! I know a lot of people have issues with re-reading books/series, I used to be one of them, but I genuinely believe that the magic and wonder of your first read can be visited again - and has the power to change you just as it did the first time around.

I always felt like I had to force myself to finish a story that I started no matter what, which in turn stretched out the time that it took to read said books and prevented me from reading other things on my list. It was beginning to be exhausting when trying to choose a new book, due to the fact that I was worried about the time I would lose having to finish something that I wasn't enjoying.
Recently I read through the first two books of the Kingkiller Chronicles and found myself completely fascinated with the world and story, so I decided to read ""The Slow Regard of Silent Things"" in hopes to satiate my desire to get more stories within Patrick Rothfuss's universe. About 25% of my way into the book, I realized that I was not enjoying the story, but again I felt like I owed it to the book to finish it, due to my love of the original works. After forcing myself to continue for a few weeks, I finally decided that this book just wasn't for me, even though I really enjoyed the original material. I decided, for the first time, to place it on my shelf, unfinished. I was surprised at how liberating it was and have now moved onto a new book that I have been dying to read and absolutely devouring it. It's almost like knowing that I can toss a book aside if I'm not enjoying it has made me even more eager to read. It's a pretty good feeling.
Has anybody else had a similar feeling? Or do you still feel obligated to finish something once you have started it, even if you aren't enjoying it?
Edit: Thanks for the gold, but if you find yourself in a giving mood think about donating to the National Center for Family Learning or your local literacy programs!",
